            The foundation of my artistic practice lies in experimental approaches to sound and music. My work engages with themes of perception and spatiality, realized through acousmatic and electroacoustic compositions, as well as live performances. Using the computer as my primary instrument, I create fictional sonic scenarios that challenge the listener's cognitive and perceptual frameworks. These works deconstruct and recontextualize sound, forming immersive sonic environments.
